Practice work

2D game made with Unity engine as a part of studies. This directory only contains the parts of code that I have made myself and it is not a complete Unity project. The programming is done in C#.

The game uses mostly free public domain assets and some stock Unity assets. 

The game is a platforming game where the characters objective is to collect as much coins as possible and at the same time dodge birds that fly on the screen. The character can move left and right and jump. The character sprite is animated with standing, running and jumping animations. Every fifth coin collected a new bird will spawn. The birds flying direction, flying height and speed are randomized each time the bird starts its flight across the screen. There are also a few spiky bushes on the level that will kill the character if she hits them.
